    <br />
    <p>“Grilled chicken burrito, no ranch avocado sauce. Substitute Fritos in for the avocado sauce.”</p>
    <p>The front of the cashier’s shoulders curved in as she leaned back and squinted at the buttons.</p>
    <p>“I was, I would like a spicy potatoes, I mean potato soft taco with Fritos substituted in for creamy chipotle sauce. Grilled please.”</p>
    <p>She poked the keypad in quick succession. Three jabs and ‘+ 0.30’ flashed in green digits on the display.</p>
    <p>“Spicy potato soft taco, minus chipotle, plus Fritos,” she repeated back, now fully caught up.</p>
    <p>“A shredded chicken mini quesadilla with Fritos substituted in for creamy chipotle sauce, not grilled please.” This time he recited the lines without pause, “I want a bean ‘n cheese burrito, no red sauce no onions, grilled please. A fresco crunchy taco with no lettuce and extra pico.”</p>
    <p>The boy of twenty-two years stood plank-like behind the counter. His gut balanced on his locked-knees which were balanced over the heels of his ‘four-stripe’ off-brand Adidas sneakers. They wobbled some but less than last time.</p>
    <p>In 10th-grade his English teacher once confessed to a fear of public speaking. “What about right now?” a classmate had asked. “That’s the thing, I don’t consider you my peers,” his teacher replied, “I’m only afraid of my peers”. In college the teacher was to give a speech on Alzheimer’s, “I practiced it dozens of times, borrowed my friend’s camcorder, recorded myself, the whole nine yards. Practiced, practiced, practiced. Memorized it word for word. When it came time to give the speech, not only were my oration and jargon flawless… but I was also able to relax and adapt to the audience. I actually told some of my best jokes during that speech.”</p>
    <p>So too had the boy practiced.</p>
    <p>“Chalupa supreme, no lettuce, extra pico.”</p>
    <p>At a rehearsed pace.</p>
    <p>“A fourthmeal crunch wrap supreme. No nacho cheese, extra tomatoes subbed in for the nacho cheese, not grilled please.”</p>
    <p>“Dat all?”</p>
    <p>“And a doritos loco taco no red sauce no onions, add guacamole and yeah.”</p>
    <p>“Dat all?”</p>
    <p>“Yes.”</p>
    <p>“Eighteen nighty eight.”</p>
    <p>He grabbed a twenty.</p>
    <p>“Do you want your receipt?”</p>
    <p>“Certain… certainly.”</p>
    <p>The boy took large cha-cha-sliding steps, one back and three left, then began to harass the man distributing orders.</p>
    <p>“Can I get a cup of water please?”</p>
    <p>And “a handful of medium-spicy salsa,” a minute later.</p>
    <p>And then, “Your ice machine on the left is broken.”</p>
    <p>“It’s not broken it’s out of water.”</p>
    <p>“Oh.”</p>
    <p>“661!”</p>
    <p>“Yes. Thank you.”</p>
    <p>He clamped the top quarter of the bag. The plastic swung and twirled beneath his grip as he walked it to the curbside out back. With one supporting hand on the dried grass, knees piked, and shins crossed, he lowered himself onto the white-speckled cement.  </p>
    <p>The first item, “doritos locos.”</p>
    <p>Seasoned beef, cheese, lettuce, and yes, the guacamole extra. The fork’s prongs lifted and combed the ingredients. All four checked out. He broke off a piece of the shell and chewed on it. Nacho Cheese. There was some potential there because, unless he was misremembering, he had not specified the shell’s flavor.</p>
    <p>Next up, “fourthmeal crunchwrap”.</p>
    <p>Each item he whispered under his breath and cross-referenced with a quick glance at the receipt.</p>
    <p>No errors on the crunchwrap.</p>
    <p>The next two also checked out.</p>
    <p>“Grilled chicken burrito, em avocado sauce, pee Fritos,” he muttered in code with closed eyes, “loaded potato griller, em creamy chipotle sauce, pee Fritos, grilled, shredded mini quesadilla, em creamy chipotle sauce, pee Fritos, not grilled, bean and cheese, em red sauce, grilled, fresco crunchy taco, em lettuce, extra pico, fourthmeal crunchwrap supreme, em cheese, extra tomatoes, not grilled, locos taco, em red, em onions, pee guac,…” his voice trailed off into a large swallow and when he opened his eyes everything glistened. Before him was an empty drive-thru and needle trees set against a hot blue sky. It all glistened in his eyes and the seasoned beef sparkled in the hot sun. The food was materialized, alive, present, and in his possession, all due to his hard work. Yes, his work— he had done mother’s chores. He had learned where cans and glass could and could not be recycled. The styrofoam could never be, never. He had done the separating very well, mother said.</p>
    <p>The image of his mother’s face filled him entirely.</p>
    <p>He wiped his nose and swallowed hard. His eyes shifted down towards the bag and noted the receipt’s lottery number was still intact: 019741, printed below his cashier’s name: Vanessa J. Xbox and Game Stop gift cards were among the prizes. This trick of cutting paper without scissors he was good at, it must’a gone all the way back to third grade. He folded just below the asterisked line and pulled either side outwards over the bend of his knee. Perfect. He tore it perfectly and held the two pieces in separate hands. He had always been good at this trick of cutting paper without scissors. It was known by some back in 3rd or 4th grade that he was the best at it. Cutting paper without scissors.</p>
    <p>He clinched his fists and pressed them against the dried grass.</p>
    <p>“Yes.”</p>
    <p>There was still hope to be found, plenty of hope, within the plastic bag at his feet. He opened the next item, a spicy potato soft taco.</p>
    <p>Little flakes of iceburg lettuce poked out from the chunky terrain of potato cubes. Potatoes, yes. Lettuce. Cheese. Fritos, yes. Chipotle sauce, no.</p>
    <p>The spicy potato checked out.</p>
    <p>He picked the Fritos and chewed them one by one, then carefully folded the tortilla back around the ingredients while thinking longingly of the future day he would earn it, pull it from the refrigerator, microwave it, sink his teeth into it.  The ‘Order Total: $18.98’, stamped on the receipt, was about half of last week’s income, forty-two and one half dollars. Half might be acceptable, definitely acceptable for treats, not just any treats, especially important treats for his new-found positive outlook, like these treats. But all the same, treats that mother did not know about. And treats that were half of last week’s income.</p>
    <p>The next item checked out as well and he couldn’t hold it in any longer.</p>
    <p>He used his hands to press his eyes shut and felt the bottom of his big palms cup beneath his jaw. “He gets it from grandma,” mom had once said after dad compared his hands to Michael Jordan’s. “But he plays basketball like Charles Barkley,” dad said, “defense and rebounds. I love Chuck. He was such a class-act.” Dad had then squeezed his hip, “but Chuck had little hands so you’re like a Chuck with big hands.”</p>
    <p>The tears rolled quickly and he tried to catch them but his eyelashes scrunched up into a mess. He curled his knuckles into a fist and pressed hard against each eye. Why me? Jesus please no longer ME. The tears rolled out of his hungry, hollow body in the hot sun and his mesh shorts fell high exposing his thigh’s soft pink skin. It was all he could manage to dry his eyes just long enough to peak out and check if anyone recognized that he was Dylan Christopherson from class of ’09.</p>
    <p>Please Jesus please. I’m yours I promise I’m yours if only please, let this last bean ‘n cheese have onions and I am yours.</p>
    <p>He peaked through the web of fingers to check if anyone was watching. This time his eyes caught those of a stranger. Through the minivan’s open window he could she was his mom’s age. He could see her face was concerned and directed towards his and he buried his deeper in the crevice of his arm.</p>
    <p>He choked back two large gulps and pressed harder and harder. When he surfaced from his wet arm, it was with a locked jaw and a fixed neck, determined not to turn towards the minivan or so much as flinch in her direction. He stood up not knowing where to walk. He decided on forward. Following the curve of the empty curbside, he wandered towards the building’s side-entrance.</p>
    <p>His confrontational side had been developed in high school. “Crab-walk!” coach Krueger would shout. He and the other wrestlers rolled from their stomachs onto their backs. Army-crawl to crab. Arms slapped down, hips rose up, and the boys scurried across the mat-padded floor, some losing direction and hitting the mat-padded walls. “Eighty-five degrees!” Those cutting weight were wrapped head to toe in thick cotton sweat suits and puddles of sweat pooled up and shined across the red mat. Crab-hands slipped in them. “Get nasty!” Between sets coach Krueger turned off the air and only their panting could be heard. His voice dropped to an intimate level, “Hate that wall. There’s a lil fucker inside you that’s questioning. Kill it with hate. Hate for the wall on the other side of the room. Line up!” The whistle blew and he hated the wall. Fucking hated it. He crab-walked across the room and socked it with an underhand and then turned his hate to opposite wall. He bear-crawled and hook-kicked it. An even strike would slap the loudest. The flat-soled wrestling shoes could strike very even and explode louder than anything else in the room. He dropped to an army-crawl and did the same to the north wall. “Bet Dylan didn’t know you could rest while bear-walking! Dylan learns something new every day!” Later when he applied the trick to his biology test, tactfully, he did well, inspiring him to use it in other domains of his life: girls, school, arguments with his parents. “Tactful passion,” coach Krueger called it. He had tried, had tried so very hard when faced with the decision of ‘vicodin and Halo’ or ‘just Halo’, but anger didn’t lend itself to working in quiet, nuanced situations such as that one was.</p>
    <p>He pushed the white, hexagonal pill out of his mind.</p>
    <p>Tactful passion.</p>
    <p>The sweat on his neck turned cold as he passed into the air-conditioning.</p>
    <p>“Hi.” He wiped his puffy eyes and held the receipt outstretched. “Are you Vanessa J?”</p>
    <p>“Yeah…”</p>
    <p>“So you just took my order,”</p>
    <p>“Yep!”</p>
    <p>“… and my taco was supposed to be cool ranch.”</p>
    <p>“Lemme see,” she grabbed the receipt. “No look you ordered the normal flavor.”</p>
    <p> “But I wanted cool ranch.”</p>
    <p>“I just took your order, I din’t hear no cool ranch.”</p>
    <p>“Who gets this complexity? Who even does that?”</p>
    <p>“What?”</p>
    <p>“No look, there is another,” he wiped his eyes, “another wrong thing, here look.” He pressed the receipt flat against the counter and they tilted their heads towards it.</p>
    <p>“Spicy potato soft taco was supposed to have fritos. It didn’t have any.”</p>
    <p>“No fritos?”</p>
    <p>“Yeah. It was missing the fritos.”</p>
    <p>“Look, you can’t come gettin’ free food every time.”</p>
    <p>He watched her bored expression, not noticing his face go stiff.</p>
    <p>“I was here last time you did this. We gotta take the next in line,” she said.</p>
    <p>Tactful passion.</p>
    <p>“Wait. I, I’m so sorry. I just. There weren’t any Fritos ya’know.”</p>
    <p>“Boh!” she yelled with cupped hands.</p>
    <p>A thin boy approached from the back. He recognized the name and the blonde ponytail and knew of him to be several grades younger. Taking a step back, he pulled his collar over his mouth and propped himself at an angle to the counter, averting his eyes down-and-away.</p>
    <p>“Did you put fritos in his loco taco?”</p>
    <p>“What’s up?” Bo grabbed the receipt.</p>
    <p>“It was, um, a Spicy potato taco, with,” he tried to clarify.</p>
    <p>Vanessa cut him off. “Ya spicy potato. You sub fritos in place that sauce? The ranch avocado.”</p>
    <p>“Lemme see.”</p>
    <p>“I have my, here. And it doesn’t have fritos.”</p>
    <p>“I put them in no?” Bo said, his voice high-pitched.</p>
    <p>“No, don’t think so.” His words were soft as they left his mouth.</p>
    <p>“You don’t think?”</p>
    <p>“No, I. Like yeah I just don’t know.”</p>
    <p>“So you admittin’ now? I got it correct huh?” Vanessa interjected.</p>
    <p>“No! No, here, lookit here.” He ducked down and fumbled through the bag.</p>
    <p>“I can just put something on,” Bo muttered.</p>
    <p>“No! He doin this every time now!”</p>
    <p>On the third try, his shaking hands found their way onto the correct item. Ignoring Vanessa’s accusations, he rolled the taco open and set the evidence on the countertop, “you see, no fritos.”</p>
    <p>“No I’m not lookin’. I know what you do. I know what you do. You aint getting no free food again.”</p>
    <p>“Ya not gonna look?”</p>
    <p>“No I’m not.”</p>
    <p>“Look’t it. How can you expect me to, when you don’t even look’t it?”</p>
    <p>She kept her eyes locked forward. “Cause I know what you do.”</p>
    <p>“Yeah? What’s that? Get the wrong order?”</p>
    <p>“No you eat it. That’s why I’m not lookin’ down. You probably eat it already. I was fine at first but this is too many.”</p>
    <p>“Look’t it damnit. No fritos. Look’t it”</p>
    <p>“We need to take our next customer.”</p>
    <p>His knees twitched forcefully as Vanessa peered around him. He placed his palms on the counter and leaned forward. One casual glance over his shoulder and the image of the Pinks’ face flashed before him.</p>
    <p>“Move it we need to take our next customer.”</p>
    <p>Ryan Pink’s mom was watching him. He was being witnessed by the eyes of parents with last names of those he went to high school with and he could not pretend to be neutral any longer. He yanked quickly on his T-shirt’s collar before the tears spilt out into the open.</p>
    <p>“Hey, I can fix one up. Not a big deal,” Bo interjected.</p>
    <p>“No!” Vanessa turned to him, “we need to ya to move on. Kay?”</p>
    <p>I… I… I’m, sorry,” he tried pulling the collar over his eyes, but caught her smug grin and sobbed uncontrollably. “I … I was just was tryin’ to… tell… you…”</p>
    <p>The corner of her lips lifted into a smirk.</p>
    <p>“… That my spicy potato don’t got any fritos.”</p>
    <p>“I’m sorry too. We need you to move it though.”</p>
    <p>“See no fritos, see no fritos!” His clenched fist landed on the taco. He mushed the soft potato cubes through his fingers and raised them to eye-level. “No fritos. It’s a free country. Goddamit a free country.”</p>
    <p>A laugh broke through the gate of her clenched lips. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”</p>
    <p>He slapped the tortilla across the counter.</p>
    <p>“Hey!”</p>
    <p>She jumped back. The lettuce and cheese clung to her polo.</p>
    <p>“Not cool!”</p>
    <p>“Yo.”</p>
    <p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” It was now him apologizing and Vanessa with the shocked expression.</p>
    <p>“You best be gettin’ out.”</p>
    <p>“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.” The tears rolled harder now than ever. “I’m… it’s… a free country… and I’m just.”</p>
    <p>“You best be leavin’ right now.”</p>
    <p>The glass door swung open under the weight of his foot.  “Fuck YOU,” his aggressive voice had no tactful passion, no trace of restraint. “It’s a free country… and I’m… I’m a rookie.” Turning back, he saw her grin once more and he ran for it, out on the familiar Muscatine Avenue, he ran for it. The length of his hometown and not one inch of it gave one measly fucker of a shit. Past Mr. Hargrove’s shed and past the gas station.</p>
    <p>He ran until his legs were nothing more than the mushed, triple-wrapped wad of taco bell squeezed under his arm. Until they pulsed with pain. Maybe his fat gut would like that. Maybe that is what the world wants.</p>
    <p>When Newport bridge came into view he slowed to a jog. Then to a walk. His mother’s disappointment filled him entirely, her broken face looking at his guilty one, her voice ripping through her vocal cords into his ears as she choked on each scream. “You haven’t been using these for? I know they can be used for.... Oh Dylan, no Dylan..” Her’s was the same level of hysteria he had just publicly lay bare to Vanessa and parents of those he went to school with and wrestled with and used to be friends with and Vanessa had sat there laughing.  </p>
    <p>Giving up on the what-tree-would-I-rather-be game, he sat on the edge of Newport bridge, his back against the guard rail and legs crossed. He had sweat-soaked half his shirt. He had cold, mushed mix of burritos and tacos for a week. He pulled out the bean n’ cheese that didn’t matter anymore and pinched the edge of the tortilla, letting it’s insides spill out.</p>
    <p>Glistening inside the mass were small, clearish cubes.</p>
    <p>Onions.</p>
    <p>He tore through the rest of the bag. Bo or Vanessa J.</p>
    <p>Bo or Vanessa.</p>
    <p>He found the receipt scrunched up in his pocket. Four items down, he found it printed in faded black text: Bean Burrito, - Red Sauce. He read it again: Bean Burrito, - Red Sauce. Each time his eyes grew wider. Bean Burrito, - Red Sauce. No onions and no minus onions. Bean Burrito, - Red Sauce. No minus onions. Vanessa J oh fuck no fuck no fuck no.</p>
    <p>He rolled the tortilla into a ball. His flat palms circulated around one another and he rolled it tighter and tighter. He clenched the ball in his big hand and stood up so as to put his shoulder’s momentum into the throw.</p>
    <p>A minivan surfaced from the oncoming lane and the driver saw him as he saw her—his mom’s age, concerned, oncoming towards him. He felt her seeing his tears and his rage. He felt that she was someone’s disappointed mother and he felt her seeing it all. Fine let her see it. Let her see everything. Now she will see it all. She will see all of it. She will see it.</p>
    <p>He pivoted athletically on a planted foot, making a full quarter turn by the time his right arm fell across his torso in a fully extended follow-through. He whipped his arm hard and launched it point-blank directly into her oncoming windshield. He saw her terrified expression evolve as it passed by in slow motion and he saw the beans splatter evenly the across tempered glass.</p>
    <p>Now it was his turn to watch her. He watched as somebody’s mother drove the remaining length of the bridge, as the lane in front of him remained cleared, and as she flipped a tight U-turn around the median.</p>
    <p>With his fingers hooked round the back of the yield sign and the toe of his sneakers wedged into an open slab on the guard rail, he used the foothold to boost himself onto the barrier’s thin upper pane, with his hand now flat to the sign’s thin metal sheet, he balanced and faced the minivan and saw her shocked eyes as they squinted disparagingly.</p>
    <p>Her hand slammed hard against the car’s horn. “BEEEEPPP!”</p>
    <p>His legs convulsed as he fell, upstream from the hydropower station’s churning wheels.</p>
    <p>“You didn’t see him? You didn’t hear my honk?”</p>
    <p>The lady screamed through her window at the passing pedestrian.</p>
    <p>“Christ! I was on my way. What’d you honk for?”</p>
    <p>“Oh my god.”</p>
    <p>“Shit! Oh no oh shit no.”</p>
    <p>The lady was not from the Taco Bell drive-thru nor was she somebody’s mother. She and the passing pedestrian were aware of last summer’s news story in which a drunk teenager died there trying to impress his girlfriend, as they dialed 911 and pointed outwards at his quickly-drifting body struggling to stay surfaced and reassured one another, “he’ll make it oh God”, “he might not make it”, and “he’s gotta make it”.</p>
