<p>Someone, not me, opened this document<br>
And typed:<br>
There are larva in my mom’s raisin bran(d)<br>
<br></p>
<p>But anyways, I have died as a moth.<br>
I have hibernated for one hundred thousand years<br>
and lived to tell the tale to you<br>
A tale of breaking bread in a Town Mall<br>
<br></p>
<p>We ate at Panera bread on a Sunday ‘eve,<br>
But there is a certain conversation lost<br>
My dear, I have lived another two hundred thousand years<br>
<br></p>
<p>My child, In the Sycamore mall, we saw X-men III<br>
There is an un-writable feeling I must write to stay true<br>
Nobody remains to register who had been lost in the light<br>
Not northern lights, nor the natural law<br>
Could make me afraid to dream of Genosha<br>
<br></p>
<p>After watching X-men, we walked<br>
Through Target’s bright lights and onto Panera Bread<br>
Squatting and loitering on a stool, nearby a stall,<br>
We laughed at the 40-year-old Panda Expresser<br>
The Cold-stoner sucker fish<br>
<br></p>
<p>I realized the contrast between X-men and Target<br>
It reminds me of how we had our talk<br>
We talked out right, because there was no one<br>
The lights flickered on and off<br>
On was X-men. Off was Target. Panera is in-between<br>
<br></p>
<p>When I watch X-men it feels like anything can happen,<br>
Walking around Target is the opposite<br>
Set so close together, Orange Julius bridges the gap<br>
Lordy thank God for bridges</p>
