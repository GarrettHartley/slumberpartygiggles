<p>In 2039 they sat in a poorly lit, five-sided shed in Southern marshes bordering the Gulf coastline and had spent the last three hours discussing the day-to-day mood cycles of Elliane’s suicidal hibernation, and whether or not she should go through with the act or “do the deed”— due to 3 main reasons and one little reason, that their “little talks had gone too far,” due to the length of the conversation and the humidity, Jeff's comments had lost clarity, but the conversation continued, digressing gradually into a blurry confusion, they did not face each other, but rather each occupied their own space, Elliane on a mattress and Jeff on a metal chair, separated by stacks of wooden dowels, a glass tank, and a hamster inside the tank.</p>
<p>“You can swim with dolphins,” Jeff slowly stated this truth about the world. He had realized yesterday while watching a YouTube video documenting an orphaned otter pup’s first six months of life. "You can swim with dolphins. There is water, and dolphins, and you control a body that knows how to swim. I think they will let you swim with them. Therefore, you shouldn’t do it."
Elliane didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen them, and they are worth every bit of it.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t know.”</p>
<p>“Why”</p>
<p>“I haven’t seen them.”</p>
<p>“No, you wouldn’t have.”</p>
<p>“I might have”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen penguins. You saying that doesn’t prove anything.”</p>
<p>“On the internet?”</p>
<p>“No in real life. That is obviously what we are talking about.”</p>
<p>“It was a question. Anyways, I’ve seen them. They are worth it.”</p>
<p>“Come sit over here,” she motioned to a chair.</p>
<p>Jeff surveyed the distance separating himself from her, <em>can I span it?</em></p>
<p>“Come sit next to me.”</p>
<p>“It is a true thing about the world that you can swim with dolphins, do you understand what I am saying?”</p>
<p>“I don’t give a shit.”</p>
<p>“Look, I don’t know what to say anymore.”</p>
<p>Jeff looked up again, <em>can I span it?</em></p>
<p>“Should I kill myself?” Elliane asked.</p>
<p>“Should I kill myself?”</p>
<p>“Yes"</p>
<p>“Why?” Jeff asked.</p>
<p>“Because you might learn what is next. You’ve learned everything worth learning here.”</p>
<p>“But I enjoy life.”</p>
<p>“Exactly, and I don’t.”</p>
<p>“Try swimming with dolphins why don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Have you ever done it?”</p>
<p>“No, but I’ve seen them.”</p>
<p>“You’ve never done it. I knew it. That is why you think it's great.”</p>
<p>“But what about the act itself? Pulling a trigger with a cold metal barrel up against your head? I enjoy moving and eating and being alive.” Jeff patted his forearms.</p>
<p>“Alive? Your forearms look like fishbellies. If I pulled a gun on you right now, you wouldn’t have the slightest idea what to do. You’re half alive and you know it.”</p>
<p>“After the trigger, a decaying body. Does that not go against life? The act of it sounds so messy. Won’t it be messy?”</p>
<p>“I know what you mean. But after laying in bed for so long, I feel quite the opposite. It sounds clean,” Elliane said while shifting about the mattress. “Come sit over here why don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Why so you can kill me?”</p>
<p>“Yes”</p>
<p>“Hold on”</p>
<p>“Sit over here, it's the least you can do.”</p>
<p>Jeff stood up to span the distance. He stopped half-way and picked up the hamster, then walked to her side.</p>
<p>“How would you like to me to sit?”</p>
<p>“Can you put it back?”</p>
<p>“I,”</p>
<p>“I’m not thinking straight, it’s okay”</p>
<p>“No, it’s okay”</p>
<p>“I was calm before, I don’t know what is happening now.”</p>
<p>“Are you scared?”</p>
<p>“Jeff”</p>
<p>“What”</p>
<p>“I’ve told you. Now come here.”</p>
<p>Jeff sat on the mattress with his back against the drywall. He turned his squished pair of green eyes towards Elliane’s hands on her lap.</p>
<p>“Are you gonna put it back?”</p>
<p>“The hamster? No.” Jeff handed her the hamster, “here.”</p>
<p>She took it and Jeff noticed her thumb tremble.</p>
<p>”I can tell you’re nervous, you shouldn’t do it,” he said.</p>
<p>“Tell me the reasons you said were not-sad reasons,” he said after a long silence.</p>
<p>“Why are the dolphins not okay?” he asked her gently.</p>
<p>“You want to know the most interesting thing I’ve learned recently?” she said, her voice cracking.</p>
<p>“Sure”</p>
<p>“The other day I focused and heard four new frequencies coming from that fan. That’s the kind of stuff I’m into now,” she playing some sort of stronger character now.  “It reminded me of this weird sensation, associated to this one time at soccer practice in high school. This was before integration. I was hungry and standing there with my knees locked, probably with low blood sugar, and I felt something. It wasn’t happy or sad or anything, just a unique overwhelming sense of awe mixed with a sense of feeling fucked in the universe. It’s not great. It’s not bad. It’s not anything. Really, it really isn’t anything. It is remarkable how nothing it is. The only, the only thing it is, is indescribable. It immediately reminded me of playing video games at Erin Castle’s house. Now every time something odd happens, like hearing four new frequencies in the fan, my mind thinks “Erin Castle - soccer practice - that feeling”, usually in that order. And I’ve never told anyone this until now. It’s such a thrill to have someone listen you know? It’s such a thrill to reveal new information. Too bad there isn’t anyone else that wants to listen. Too bad that’s the last interesting thing I have kept from telling you. And learning something, oh god, forget that. I promise there isn’t anything else there.”</p>
<p>“Why are you so obsessed with learning? You know there are other pleasures.”</p>
<p>“Please you make it sound like I’m about to take up sex work. Ha! A bottom barrell loser like me? I’m fucking depressed. I’m fucked. I’m out.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you try swimming with dolphins?”</p>
<p>“Have you ever swallowed sea water?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Directly swallowed? No.”</p>
<p>“Yeah”</p>
<p>“But that’s not important. We can shove a pacifier in your mouth or something.”</p>
<p>“I won’t be able to breathe.”</p>
<p>“Your nose”</p>
<p>“Do they have oxygen tanks that come through the nose?”</p>
<p>“No. No gas tank. You’ll breathe air.”</p>
<p>“No oxygen tank?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you breathe when you surface. Like normal swimming.”</p>
<p>“But the water will leak into my nose.”</p>
<p>“But not your mouth right? You won’t taste it.”</p>
<p>“I’ll smell it.”</p>
<p>Jeff took the hamster from her.  <em>I need to entertain and distract.</em> He stood up to take the hamster back, “But the taste from sea water is the actual taste. For fungus, or bacteria, or green peas the taste is mostly the smell. Having bacteria shoved up your nose would be worse than shoved into your mouth with your nose pinched, right? But with sea water, it’s the salt that makes it unbearable, salt, one of the five tastes. You can solve this with a pacifier.”</p>
<p>“No, I still wish it was the smell. If it was the smell that was unbearable, I could find a thing that pinches my nose.”</p>
<p>“Those are harder to find”</p>
<p>“We’re traveling to the Caribbean and we can’t stop for a nose clip?”</p>
<p>“No not the Caribbean. There are dolphins here in the Gulf. You’re not connected?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t been connected for a couple months, I told you that. I should revoke the joy I felt in telling you about my feelings. Maybe I you can listen this time and I can squeeze a little more joy out of life before,"</p>
<p>“Don’t, I just forgot. Anyways the dolphins are here. I saw them as a kid.”</p>
<p>“The cute kind?”</p>
<p>“Bottlenose, yeah.”</p>
<p>“I wish it was the scent that was unbearable. I could find a nose clip and breathe with my mouth as I prefer.”</p>
<p>“You would swallow the sea water and get sick. You are lucky.”</p>
<p>“If I was lucky God would have let me retain my blowhole from evolution as a vestigial appendage.”</p>
<p>Jeff gasped, over hysterically and smiled at her, “don’t say words like that. This isn’t a time for words like that!”</p>
<p>Her neck stayed motionless, bent downwards.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to kill off that impressive vocabulary now do we?”</p>
<p>“Yes keep talking. That will help.”</p>
<p>“You know I don’t owe you anything, right? You know the universe doesn’t owe you anything?”</p>
<p>“You did start it.”</p>
<p>“You can frame anything like that. You’re responsible for it.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, bad habits,” she muttered to herself.</p>
<p>They stopped talking. Jeff lifted his sweatshirt hood. Fifty years ago they would have had kids. Jeff and Elliane, born fifty years ago, a crew of two in Baldwin, Alabama. "A crew of two," he let slip through his mouth, "a crew... of two."</p>
<p>"What’s good?" she asked.</p>
<p>"A crew of two. Fifty years ago, with kids."</p>
<p>“Dolphins," he muttered inaudibly to change is answer.</p>
<p>“I feel like... this is the correct ending, and it has to be a tragedy for it all to make sense. Is there anything fine left for me to learn? Tell me, something about this world.”</p>
<p>“I thought it wasn’t emotional.”</p>
<p>“It’s not. But in the end, my mind needs to make it that way, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Wind from the black night blew fresh humid air into the shed’s screen window above their heads. but he still listened to Elliane as she recited her 3 “not-sad” reasons and repeatedly assured herself that her feeling moments prior to committing the act were in line with “harmony of nature and natural processes”. Jeff shuffled his body around, swung his legs overtop of her, laid down by her side.</p>
<p>“From cuddled to killed, impossible fifty years ago,” Jeff said out loud.</p>
<p>He tapped his thumbs against her arms in rhythm with the snare and bass drums of the slow-paced song playing from her iPhone, something he’d always done, a cornerstone of their relationship, it was perhaps the last piece of their relationship left unspoken. Like a junkie beating something into the dirt, all the other small nuances had been yanked into conscious conversation by a hidden, anxious version of Jeff that consistently expressed its dissatisfaction by ruining quiet moments with stories of his childhood, thoughts from that day, and pointing out these small nuances in their relationship, like this habit of tapping drum beats while holding her. Somehow though, he had managed to never communicate this one.</p>
<p>Jeff now imagined a physical drum head with rows of springs beneath the hollow interior being struck by a wooden stick in order to create gradients in sound pressure that move an inductor coil inside a microphone, the electric signal stored in flash memory, and the inductor coil in her speaker now vibrating air back towards the mechanically-gated ion channels in his inner ear, sending a nervous signal of a snare drum sound to his mind. The image of the tight, vibrating drum head, inside a cloud of settling dust, as if just beaten into the ground by a junkie, now framed his relationship with Elliane.
The two were similar in so many ways. They were so similar, it had changed Jeff’s intuition towards the diversity of life on earth’s crust. Like a pebble glued into an asphalt road, spending one-hundred years pressed against a pebble of nearly identical size and shape, his intuition towards what should and should not be expected of a neighbor was altered and out of touch with reality.</p>
<p>Life now was different than it was for the mound builders who occupied the land seven thousand years ago. Jeff let his mind slip and thought of his life as phases, like thick leaves representing different phases of his time, woven into a mat that represented his life. Just as each leaf’s growth was framed in an environment, a tree branch, that preceded the leaf’s existence, so too were the phases of his life organized by cultural norms that preceded him spawning into his home 22 years ago— high-school, internships, vacations, and college, all split into several mini-phases, occurring with different moods that were strongly related to the climate of the city he lived in, the season, the music he listened to, and his main daily activity. The final hour of each phase, from age 17 until now, was nostalgia. Then, later, the nostalgia for a given phase came back and bite him, intensely, a total of two to three more times after the phase was over and he had moved into a new one. The space between leaves in the mat was th
